# Sarcasm Detection in News Headlines with NLP
In this challenge, you will work on a dataset that contains news headlines - which are aimed to be written in a sarcastic manner by the news author. Our job here is to build our NLP models and predict whether the headline is sarcastic or not. 

You must upload a CSV with your predictions on the test data, and also upload a notebook showing all your work. 

Uploading your notebook is mandatory for getting a certificate for the bootcamp.

Each record of the dataset consists of two attributes:

* is_sarcastic: 1 if the record is sarcastic, otherwise 0. This is the target variable.

* headline: this is the headline of the news article

Saving Prediction File & Sample Submission:

* Make sure your CSV has a column labeled as 'prediction'

* Number of rows in CSV should match with number of rows in Test Data given below

The Accuracy score on Test data will be used to evaluate your submission.

### Submission guidelines
